Here are the test scenarios in English for the `complex_addition` function. Since the language is English, the text is designed left-to-right as per standard conventions:

---

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Validate correct summation for a balanced input of real and imaginary parts
Details:
  TestName: test_balanced_input_summation
  Description: Validate that the function correctly computes the sum for evenly distributed real and imaginary parts provided by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Simulate the user input with a list of four integers: [2, 4, 6, 8].
    - Mock the `input()` function to return "2 4 6 8" as input.
  Act:
    - Invoke the `complex_addition` function.
  Assert:
    - Expect the function to return the string "8+ i18", where `real_sum` is 2+6=8 and `imag_sum` is 4+8=12.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the summation logic for real and imaginary numbers alternates correctly when provided with a balanced input while including the last number in the `imag_sum`.

Scenario 2: Validate behavior when all numbers fall into real summation indexes
Details:
  TestName: test_all_real_numbers
  Description: Assert the behavior when the input contains only two numbers acting as real components.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Simulate user input with an integer list: [3, 5].
    - Mock the `input()` function to return "3 5".
  Act:
    - Call the `complex_addition` function.
  Assert:
    - Expect the result to be "3+ i5", correctly partitioning `real_sum` to 3 and `imag_sum` to the last number, 5.
Validation:
  Tests edge cases where only a minimum of two numbers is provided, validating correct partitioning of the input.

Scenario 3: Validate with more weights on imaginary numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_imaginary_weighted
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle more numbers weighted toward imaginary components.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Simulate user input as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
    - Mock the `input()` function to return this sequence as input.
  Act:
    - Execute the `complex_addition` function.
  Assert:
    - The function should output "4+ i10", where `real_sum` includes 1, 3, 5 while the rest ISCN key.
