Scenario 1: Verify subtraction of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_number_subtraction
  Description: This test ensures that when two positive numbers are provided, the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare inputs for two positive numbers, e.g., 15 and 5.
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct result, which should be 10.
Validation:
  The test is crucial to validate the primary functionality of the subtraction operation for standard positive inputs, ensuring the core logic works as expected.

---

Scenario 2: Verify subtraction of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_number_subtraction
  Description: This test ensures that the function can handle negative inputs correctly and performs the subtraction operation properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare inputs for two negative numbers, e.g., -10 and -4.
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the expected result, which should be -6.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to mathematical rules for dealing with negative numbers, a critical aspect of its correctness.

---

Scenario 3: Verify subtraction where the first number is smaller than the second
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_negative_result
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns a correct negative result when the first number is smaller than the second.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare inputs where the first number is smaller, e.g., 8 and 12.
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct result, which should be -4.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate that the function computes the correct subtraction result even when it involves negative outcomes.

---

Scenario 4: Verify subtraction involving zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the subtraction function when either or both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare several input cases, such as 0 and 5, 7 and 0, and 0 and 0.
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function for each case.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns correct results: -5, 7, and 0, respectively.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles zero appropriately, which is an edge case in subtraction operations.

---

Scenario 5: Verify subtraction of large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_number_subtraction
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately subtracts two very large numbers without overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare large inputs, e.g., 1e12 (1 trillion) and 5e11 (500 billion).
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct result: 5e11 (500 billion).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function operates correctly with large numerical inputs, avoiding potential issues with numerical precision or range.

---

Scenario 6: Verify subtraction of floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_floating_point_number_subtraction
  Description: This test ensures that the function can appropriately handle and subtract floating-point numbers while maintaining precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare inputs with decimals, such as 12.5 and 3.2.
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct result, which should be 9.3.
Validation:
  Floating-point operations often introduce minor inaccuracies; hence, this test is necessary to confirm the function's precision and reliability.

---

Scenario 7: Verify behavior with invalid user inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test verifies how the function handles invalid user inputs, such as non-numeric values, and ensures appropriate error-handling mechanisms.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate scenarios where user inputs are non-numeric or strings, e.g., "abc" or "NaN".
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function.
  Assert: Verify the function raises a `ValueError` or behaves as expected (e.g., validation failed).
Validation:
  This test ensures the robustness of the function by confirming its ability to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

---

Scenario 8: Verify repeated execution of the function with varied inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_repeated_execution
  Description: This test ensures the function provides accurate results consistently across multiple, varied invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a sequence of input pairs, such as (10, 3), (100, 50), (-20, -10), and (0, 5).
  Act: Simulate user inputs through mock input function or patching, and invoke the `subtraction` function for each pair.
  Assert: Verify correct results for each pair: 7, 50, -10, and -5.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function maintains consistent accuracy when executed repeatedly, which is critical for real-world usage.

---

Scenario 9: Verify subtraction performance for large number of invocations
Details:
  TestName: test_performance_large_invocations
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and ensures it executes efficiently when called a large number of times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a loop to invoke the function 100,000 times with varying inputs.
  Act: Use mocking or patching to simulate user inputs and invoke the function repetitively.
  Assert: Verify prompt execution without noticeable delays or errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function scalability and performance efficiency, which are valuable for applications requiring frequent invocations.
