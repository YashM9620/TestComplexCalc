Scenario 1: Valid average calculation with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the average when given a space-separated series of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test input such as "10 20 30 40 50".
  Act: Simulate the input using mocking or redirection and invoke the average() function.
  Assert: Confirm that the output is the correct average, i.e., 30.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of testing typical positive integer inputs, which represent one of the most common use cases for the function. Accurate average calculation in this scenario is critical to validate the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Valid average calculation with negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_negative_integers
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly calculates the average when the input consists of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an input such as "-10 -20 -30 -40 -50".
  Act: Simulate the user input and invoke the average() function.
  Assert: Verify that the output is the average, i.e., -30.0.
Validation:
  Including negative numbers tests the robustness and correctness of the function, ensuring that it handles non-positive values gracefully.

Scenario 3: Average calculation when numbers include both positive and negative values
Details:
  TestName: test_average_mixed_integers
  Description: Evaluate the function's behavior and average computation when the series includes both positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a series such as "10 -20 30 -40 50".
  Act: Call the function and observe its result.
  Assert: Ensure the output matches the expected average, i.e., 6.0.
Validation:
  This scenario tests mixed ranges, which may occur frequently in financial calculations or other real-world applications.

Scenario 4: Single number input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_single_input
  Description: Verify the behavior of the function when the input consists of a single number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide the input "25".
  Act: Invoke the average() function.
  Assert: Confirm the return value is the single number itself, i.e., 25.0.
Validation:
  Testing edge cases like single-number inputs ensures that the function handles minimal input gracefully and as expected.

Scenario 5: Error handling for empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_empty_input
  Description: Ensure the function appropriately handles cases where the user does not enter any data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the input as an empty string.
  Act: Call the average() function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function raises a ValueError or an appropriate exception indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Robust error handling is essential for user-facing functions. This test validates that the function does not compute invalid results.

Scenario 6: Non-integer number input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_float_input
  Description: Confirm that the function handles and calculates averages correctly when the input contains floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use input data such as "10.5 20.7 30.2".
  Act: Redirect input and invoke the average() function.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the computed average, e.g., 20.466666666666665.
Validation:
  Although the function explicitly maps inputs to integers, testing this scenario reveals whether the input validation aligns with stated requirements or unintentionally accommodates non-integer inputs.

Scenario 7: Large number input to test function scalability
Details:
  TestName: test_average_large_numbers
  Description: Assess the performance and accuracy of the function when given a series of large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate an input such as "1000000 2000000 3000000 4000000 5000000".
  Act: Utilize redirection to provide the input and execute the average() function.
  Assert: Verify that the computed average is 3000000.0.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the scalability and ensures the function can handle large numeric inputs without performance degradation or overflow errors.

Scenario 8: Boundary case with zero values
Details:
  TestName: test_average_all_zeros
  Description: Check the function's behavior when all inputs are zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an input like "0 0 0 0 0".
  Act: Invoke the average() function by simulating the user input process.
  Assert: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average as 0.0.
Validation:
  Testing zero input ensures accuracy in special cases and confirms no anomalies occur when handling neutral values.

Scenario 9: Factorial module import relevance test
Details:
  TestName: test_average_irrelevant_imports
  Description: Verify that the function does not depend on irrelevant imports such as `factorial` and `os` to conduct average calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Confirm that the function definition remains functional without these imports.
  Act: Execute the function without invoking any unrelated modules like `factorial`.
  Assert: Ensure that no errors occur during execution related to these imports.
Validation:
  This test validates the modularity and precision of the function by ensuring unnecessary dependencies do not impact execution.

Scenario 10: Input length validation with very large series
Details:
  TestName: test_average_large_series
  Description: Test the function's handling of extremely long input series to validate its ability to compute averages for large datasets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a simulated input with thousands of values, such as "1 2 3 ... 10000".
  Act: Execute the function and measure the processing duration and correctness of output.
  Assert: Confirm that the average is correctly computed within acceptable performance constraints.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is viable for use in scenarios with large datasets and performs efficiently.
