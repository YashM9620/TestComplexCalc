Scenario 1: Verify the calculation of the average for a list of positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function calculates the average of a list containing only positive integers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an input string of positive integers separated by spaces.
  Act: Simulate input using the string and invoke the `average` function.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value matches the expected average of the given numbers.
Validation:
  This is a foundational test because correctly calculating the average for positive integers is a core aspect of the function's business logic.

Scenario 2: Verify the calculation of the average for a mixture of positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_positive_and_negative_integers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly handles a mix of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string containing both positive and negative integers separated by spaces.
  Act: Simulate input using the string and execute the `average` function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected average, including the influence of negative values.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function handles real-world cases, which often involve a combination of positive and negative values.

Scenario 3: Verify division by zero error handling when the input provided is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_average_empty_input
  Description: This test ensures the function properly handles cases where no numbers are provided and raises an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare empty input (e.g., a blank string).
  Act: Simulate input submission and invoke the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` or similar exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles edge cases gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes due to invalid input.

Scenario 4: Verify the calculation of the average with a single number in the input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_single_number
  Description: This test confirms that the function returns the same number when only one number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a single number as input (e.g., "42").
  Act: Simulate input submission and call the `average` function.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value is equal to the single number provided.
Validation:
  This test validates correct behavior for minimal input scenarios, ensuring accuracy even for special cases.

Scenario 5: Verify the calculation with all provided numbers being the same
Details:
  TestName: test_average_identical_numbers
  Description: This test ensures the function returns the same value as any of the provided numbers when all the numbers are identical.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input with repeated instances of the same number (e.g., "5 5 5 5").
  Act: Simulate input submission and execute the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify the output matches the identical number.
Validation:
  This test ensures consistent behavior for cases with no variance in the data.

Scenario 6: Verify proper calculation when input values are very large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_large_numbers
  Description: This test checks if the function can accurately calculate the average for a list containing very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input comprising large numbers (e.g., "1000000000 2000000000 3000000000").
  Act: Simulate input submission and invoke the `average` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the calculated average matches the mathematically expected result.
Validation:
  This ensures the function handles edge cases involving high numerical values without overflow or precision issues.

Scenario 7: Verify the calculation for decimal-equivalent averages
Details:
  TestName: test_average_floating_point_result
  Description: This test ensures the function calculates averages that result in decimal values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an input sequence where the expected average is not an integer (e.g., "10 15 25").
  Act: Provide the sequence and invoke the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result matches the expected floating-point average (e.g., 16.666...).
Validation:
  This ensures the function performs accurate division, supporting all numeric results, including floats.

Scenario 8: Verify handling of input containing trailing/leading spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_average_input_with_spaces
  Description: This test verifies that the function trims input appropriately and processes it without errors if extra whitespace is present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input with leading and trailing spaces (e.g., "  5 10 15 20  ").
  Act: Simulate input and invoke the `average` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the average is calculated as expected regardless of the trailing/leading spaces.
Validation:
  This ensures a robust user experience, allowing flexibility in input formatting.

Scenario 9: Verify the handling of zero values in the input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zeros
  Description: This test confirms that the function correctly includes zeros in calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide input containing one or more zero values (e.g., "0 0 10 20").
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with this input.
  Assert: Check if the zero values are included in the calculation, producing the correct average.
Validation:
  This ensures the function adheres to expected behavior when encountering zero values.

Scenario 10: Verify calculation with non-uniform spacing in the input string
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_irregular_spacing
  Description: This test ensures the function can handle inputs where numbers are separated by inconsistent spacing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide input with numbers separated by multiple spaces (e.g., "2   4  6").
  Act: Simulate input submission and execute the function.
  Assert: Confirm the calculation correctly ignores uneven spaces and computes the average accurately.
Validation:
  This improves the functionâ€™s robustness, allowing input flexibility without errors or miscalculations.
