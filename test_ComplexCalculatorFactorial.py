Scenario 1: Verify the factorial of a small positive integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_small_positive_integer
  Description: Ensure that the function computes the correct factorial for a small positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to a small positive integer, such as 5.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected factorial (5! = 120).
Validation:
  This test validates the basic functionality of the function for typical input and ensures correctness of the calculation under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Verify the factorial of zero
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_zero
  Description: Confirm that the function correctly handles the edge case where `num` is zero, as the factorial of zero is defined as 1 (0! = 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to 0.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result, 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the mathematical definition of factorial when applied to the edge case of `num = 0`.

Scenario 3: Verify the factorial of 1 (edge case)
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_one
  Description: Ensure that the function accurately calculates the factorial of 1, which is always 1 (1! = 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to 1.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result, 1.
Validation:
  This test validates correct handling of the first positive edge case, which is fundamental to the logic of calculating factorials.

Scenario 4: Verify the factorial of a larger positive integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_large_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the function calculates the factorial for a larger input value, testing for correctness with higher iterations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to a large positive integer, such as 10.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected result (10! = 3,628,800).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the iterative calculation of the factorial performs correctly across multiple iterations.

Scenario 5: Validate that the function raises an error for negative input
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_negative_number
  Description: Confirm that the function raises a `ValueError` when a negative number is passed, as factorial is undefined for negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to a negative integer, like -5.
  Act: Attempt to call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Assert that a `ValueError` is raised with the expected error message: "factorial is undefined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  This test guarantees that the function correctly enforces the non-negative integer constraint, in line with mathematical rules.

Scenario 6: Validate that the function raises an error for non-integer input
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_non_integer
  Description: Ensure that the function raises a `ValueError` when a non-integer value is passed, as factorial can only be applied to integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to a float (e.g., 5.5) or a string (e.g., "5").
  Act: Attempt to call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Assert that a `ValueError` is raised with the expected error message: "Input must be an integer."
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres strictly to its type requirements for inputs, protecting against invalid operations.

Scenario 7: Verify the factorial of a very large number (performance test)
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_very_large_number
  Description: Test the function with a very large positive integer to evaluate performance and any potential issues with stack limits or computational accuracy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to a very large integer, such as 1000.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Ensure the result matches the expected factorial value or verify that no errors related to computation or resources occur.
Validation:
  This test assesses the robustness of the function when handling extremely large inputs, ensuring it performs efficiently and correctly under stress.

Scenario 8: Verify the factorial of a boundary case near 0
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_boundary_case_near_0
  Description: Confirm that the function accurately calculates the factorial for values immediately greater than 0, such as `num = 2`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to 2.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result (2! = 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly for values close to 0, verifying consistent computation in edge-adjacent scenarios.

Scenario 9: Verify if factorial function handles repeated invocations
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_repeated_invocations
  Description: Ensure that the function can handle repeated calls efficiently without any degradation in performance or unexpected behaviors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select multiple valid inputs (e.g., 3, 4, 5) to be tested in repeated function calls.
  Act: Call the function `factorial(num)` multiple times in a loop, each time with a different input value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values are correct for each input and that no state leakage or side effects occur across calls.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is stateless and reusable, which is critical for use in larger applications or multiple iterations.

Scenario 10: Verify the factorial function with minimal input size
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_with_minimal_input_size
  Description: Ensure that the function successfully calculates and returns correct results for the smallest input, `num = 0`, without throwing errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num` to 0.
  Act: Call `factorial(num)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value equals the expected result (0! = 1).
Validation:
  This test establishes the correctness of the function under scenarios where minimal input is provided, ensuring robustness in lower boundary cases.
