Scenario 1: Calculation of Factorial for a Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the factorial of a positive integer input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer (e.g., 5) for which the factorial result is known.
  Act: Call the factorial function with this positive integer.
  Assert: Check that the returned result matches the expected factorial value (e.g., factorial(5) should return 120).
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function performs its primary operation: calculating the factorial of a given positive integer, validating correctness for standard cases.
