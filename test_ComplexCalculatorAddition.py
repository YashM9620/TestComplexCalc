Scenario 1: Verify the correctness of the sum when provided with a set of positive integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly computes the sum when the input is a set of positive integers. This verifies the core functionality of the addition logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of a sequence of positive integers, e.g., "4 7 12".
  Act: The function is invoked, and the simulated input will be passed to it.
  Assert: The function's return value should be equal to the correct sum of all inputs. For the provided example, it should return 23.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the primary arithmetic operation (addition) performs as intended for the simplest case, which is integral to the business logic of the function.

Scenario 2: Verify the function’s behavior when supplied with negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_integers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly processes and sums negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of a series of negative integers, e.g., "-3 -8 -5".
  Act: The function is invoked with the simulated input.
  Assert: The function’s result should correctly sum the negative integers. For this input, the result should be -16.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the function handles negative integers appropriately, ensuring it supports all integer values in the number spectrum as expected.

Scenario 3: Validate the function's response to mixed positive and negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test ensures that the function produces the correct result when given a mix of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input, such as "5 -3 8 -4 6".
  Act: Invoke the function with the simulated input.
  Assert: The sum of these numbers should equal 12.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function can handle varying combinations of positive and negative values, providing real-world robustness.

Scenario 4: Test the function’s response to zero values in the input list.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zeros
  Description: This test evaluates the function’s ability to correctly handle zero values intermixed with other integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input with some zeros, e.g., "0 4 0 9".
  Act: Invoke the function and pass this input.
  Assert: The sum should exclude the zeros while summing the other values. For the provided input, the result should be 13.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function adheres to mathematical rules whereby adding zero does not change the sum.

Scenario 5: Verify the function when no input is provided by the user.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_empty_input
  Description: This test ensures that the function appropriately handles the edge case where no input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the scenario where the user presses enter without providing any numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function and pass this simulated input.
  Assert: The function should raise a `ValueError` since it cannot convert empty input to integers.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function's robustness against invalid or empty user input, addressing critical edge cases.

Scenario 6: Check the function with a single numeric input.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_single_input
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the user inputs only one number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of a single number, e.g., "7".
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: The function should return the number itself since it is the only input. For this example, the result should be 7.
Validation:
  Confirms the function behaves appropriately with the minimum valid input size (a single number).

Scenario 7: Validate the handling of very large numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test checks whether the function can process and handle large numerical inputs without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of very large numbers, e.g., "1000000000 2000000000 3000000000".
  Act: Invoke the function with the simulated input.
  Assert: The result should be the correct sum of these numbers. For this input, the outcome should be 6000000000.
Validation:
  Tests the function's capability to process large numerical computations, ensuring stability for high-bound inputs.

Scenario 8: Check the function’s behavior with non-integer input from the user.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_non_integer_input
  Description: This test ensures that the function appropriately handles cases where the input includes non-integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input such as "5 7.5 abc".
  Act: Invoke the function and use this malformed input.
  Assert: The function should raise a `ValueError` when it encounters non-integers that cannot be converted into integers.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function implements input validation and handles erroneous non-integer inputs gracefully.

Scenario 9: Ensure proper behavior with duplicate numbers in the input.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_duplicate_numbers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly sums numbers even if there are duplicates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input with duplicate values, e.g., "5 5 5 10".
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: The sum should include duplicates, and the result for this example should be 25.
Validation:
  Ensures the function handles repeated numbers correctly, as duplicates are a valid input scenario.

Scenario 10: Test the behavior of the function when the input includes whitespace irregularities.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_irregular_whitespace
  Description: This test ensures the function handles additional spaces or irregular whitespace between numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input with irregular spacing, such as "2    4  6".
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: The function should compute the sum correctly as it ignores extra spaces. For this input, the result should be 12.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's robustness in accepting and processing user input with irregular formatting.
